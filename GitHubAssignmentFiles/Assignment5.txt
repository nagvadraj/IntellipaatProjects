# Step 1: Initialize Git Flow
git flow init -d

# Step 2: Create all the required branches (master, develop, feature/feature_branch, hotfix/hotfix_branch)
# No need to create branches manually, git-flow will create them on demand.

# Step 3: Starting from the feature branch, push the branch to the master
# Create a new feature branch
git flow feature start my_feature

# Work on your feature branch, make changes, stage, and commit them

# When the feature is complete, merge it into the develop branch
git flow feature finish my_feature

# Merge develop into master
git checkout master
git merge develop

# Step 4: Push a urgent.txt on master using hotfix
# Create a hotfix branch
git flow hotfix start urgent_fix

# Make the necessary changes in the hotfix branch, stage, and commit them

# Finish the hotfix, merging it into both master and develop
git flow hotfix finish urgent_fix

# Push branches and tags to the remote repository
git push origin --all
git push origin --tags
